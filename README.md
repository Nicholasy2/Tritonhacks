## About
Our homepage breifly explains the game and shows a video of the gameplay. In addition, we have multiple tabs and buttons that redirect you to view some of the characters and maps in the game. Finally, there is an Aim Trainer game that follows both the first person shooter game and Wack a Mole game.
